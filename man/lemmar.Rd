\title{Dictionary Based Lemmatization}
\description{
Utilizes tokenization and dictionary lookup for lemmatization of text.
Lemmatization is defined as  "grouping together the inflected forms of a word
so they can be analysed as a single item" (wikipedia).  While dictionary
lookup of tokens is not a true morphological analysis, this style of lemma
replacement is fast and typically still robust for many applications
